One of the major reason crypto got mainstream attention is because of the
"Buy low, sell high" strategy associated with trading ERC20s,ERC721s,etc.

"Crypto high volatility" is the reason it works. 
Many alphas, including @sandeepnailwal of Polygon consider this trading of shitcoins or as
I like to call it "fake currencies",  a bane of blockchain.

Anyways, it introduced the notion of having something of "Value" on the blockchain.
A fungible asset qualifies as "money" if it follows the following three characteristics :
1) It can be used as a UNIT OF ACCOUNT
2) It can be used as MEDIUM OF EXCHANGE
3) It acts as a STORE OF VALUE
